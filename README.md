# AlgoRush

**📌 Competitive Programming Repository**  
Welcome to my **Codeforces & Algorithmic Competitions** repository! 🚀 This is where I store my solutions, templates, and strategies for **competitive programming** contests. The goal is to continuously improve, learn new algorithms, and push my limits.  

📂 **Contents:**  
✅ Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode solutions  
✅ Common algorithm templates (DP, Graphs, Greedy, etc.)  
✅ Notes & tricks for faster problem-solving  
✅ My journey from WA ➝ AC ➝ Grandmaster  

Join the grind, optimize the code, and **never stop learning**! 💡🔥
